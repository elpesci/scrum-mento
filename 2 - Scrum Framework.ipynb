    "# The Scrum Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "In  a nutshell, Scrum  requires a  Scrum  Master  to  foster  an  environment  where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A Product Owner orders and prioritizes the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog\n",
    "2. The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint\n",
    "3. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint\n",
    "4. *Repeat*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scrum  Theory\n",
    "Scrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions  based on what is observed. Lean thinking reduces waste and focuses on the essentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and to control risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scrum engages groups of people who collectively have all the skills and expertise to do the work and share or acquire such skills as needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Scrum combines four formal events for inspection and adaptation within a containing event, the Sprint. These events work because they implement the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transparency\n",
    "Work process and resulting products must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work. With Scrum, important decisions are based on the perceived state of its three formal *artifacts*. Artifacts that  have  low  transparency can lead to decisions that diminish value and increase risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transparency enables inspection. Inspection without transparency is misleading and wasteful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inspection\n",
    "The Scrum  artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help with inspection, Scrum provides cadence in the form of its five *events*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspection enables adaptation. Inspection without adaptation is considered pointless. Scrum events are designed to provoke change.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adaptation\n",
    "If any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits or if the resulting product is unacceptable, the process being  applied or the materials being produced must be adjusted. The adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further  deviation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Adaptation becomes more difficult when the people involved are not empowered or self-managing. A Scrum Team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything new through inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scrum Values\n",
    "Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Value | Description |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| Commitment | The Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each other |\n",
    "| Focus | Primary focus is on the work of the Sprint to make the best possible progress toward these goals |\n",
    "| Openness | The Scrum Team and its stakeholders are open about the work and the challenges |\n",
    "| Respect | Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people, and are respected as such by the people  with whom they work |\n",
    "| Courage | Scrum Team members have the courage to do the right thing, to work on tough problems |\n",
    "\n",
    "When these values are embodied by the Scrum Team and the people they work with, the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life building trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scrum Team\n",
    "The fundamental unit of Scrum is a small team of people, a Scrum Team. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Scrum Team consists of one Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers (3 roles). Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams or hierarchies. It is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal. Everyone does everything... no one has a \"that's not my job\" attitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scrum Teams are cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint. They are also self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and how.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Scrum Team is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint, typically 10 or fewer people. The ideal size for a development team is between 3 and 9 people, not including the scrum master and product owner. If Scrum Teams become too large, they should consider reorganizing into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same product. Therefore, they should share the same Product Goal, Product Backlog, and Product Owner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required. They are structured and empowered by the organization to manage their own work. Working in Sprints at a sustainable pace improves the Scrum Team’s focus and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire Scrum Team is accountable for creating a valuable, useful increment every Sprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Product Owner\n",
    "The product owner defines the why, who, and what—why it is worthwhile to develop a product, who it is for, and what features it should contain. Product owners own a product in its entirety; they have the final word on strategic and tactical product decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Product Owner is also accountable for effective *Product Backlog* management, which includes:\n",
    "- Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal;\n",
    "- Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items;\n",
    "- Prioritizing / ordering Product Backlog items; and,\n",
    "- Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scrum Master\n",
    "Scrum masters hold the scrum team accountable to their working agreements, scrum values, and to the scrum framework itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scrum master helps the scrum team perform at their highest level. They also protect the team from both internal and external distractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scrum Masters are true leaders who serve the Scrum Team (Product Owner and Developers) and the larger organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Developers (Team Members)\n",
    "Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint. They decide how to accomplish the work set forth by the product owner (empowered).\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific skills needed by the Developers are often broad and will vary with the domain of work.\n",
    "However, the Developers are always accountable for:\n",
    "- Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog;\n",
    "- Instilling (gradually but firmly establish) quality by adhering to a Definition of Done;\n",
    "- Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal; and,\n",
    "- Holding each other accountable as professionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scrum Artifacts\n",
    "Scrum’s artifacts help manage the work. Scrum’s artifacts represent work or value. They are designed to maximize transparency of key information. Thus, everyone inspecting them has the same basis for adaptation.\n",
    "Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured:\n",
    "- For the Product Backlog it is the Product Goal.\n",
    "- For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal.\n",
    "- For the Increment it is the Definition of Done.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Product Backlog\n",
    "An emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product and includes the product goal. It is the\n",
    "single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Product Backlog items that can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint are deemed ready for selection in a Sprint Planning event. They usually acquire this degree of transparency after refining activities. Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items. This is an ongoing activity to add details, such as a description, order, and size. Attributes often vary with the domain of work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Developers who will be doing the work are responsible for the sizing. The Product Owner may influence the Developers by helping them understand and select trade-offs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Commitment: Product Goal\n",
    "To plan the work to be done each sprint, teams need an idea of their product's overall objective. Each team may have multiple product goals over its lifetime, but only one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Product Goal describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against. The Product Goal is in the Product Backlog. The rest of the Product Backlog emerges to define “what” will fulfill the Product Goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sprint Backlog\n",
    "The set of product backlog items selected for the sprint by the developers (team members), plus a plan for delivering the increment and realizing the sprint goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the Developers. It is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Developers plan to accomplish during the Sprint in order to achieve the Sprint Goal. Consequently, the Sprint Backlog is updated throughout the Sprint as more is learned. It should have enough detail that they can inspect their progress in the Daily Scrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Commitment: Sprint Goal\n",
    "The Sprint Goal is the single objective for the Sprint. A specific and singular purpose for the sprint backlog. This goal helps everyone focus on the essence of what needs to be done and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sprint Goal is created during the Sprint Planning event and then added to the Sprint Backlog. As the Developers work during the Sprint, they keep the Sprint Goal in mind. If the work turns out to be different than they expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of the Sprint Backlog within the Sprint without affecting the Sprint Goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Increment\n",
    "A sum of usable sprint backlog items completed by the developers in the sprint that meets the definition of done, plus the value of all the increments that came before.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Each increment is a recognizable, visibly improved, operating version of the product.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. In order to provide value, the Increment must be usable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Commitment: Definition Of Done (DOD)\n",
    "The Definition of Done is a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "The moment a Product Backlog item meets the Definition of Done, an Increment is born. When the increment is delivered, it needs to meet a shared understanding of what “done” means. The definition of done ensures that the standard of quality is met. The definition of done can differ between organizations and teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Definition of Done creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment. If a Product Backlog item does not meet the Definition of Done, it cannot be released or even presented at the Sprint Review. Instead, it returns to the Product Backlog for future consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scrum Events\n",
    "Each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts. These events are specifically designed to enable the transparency required. Failure to operate any events as prescribed results in lost opportunities to inspect and adapt. Events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimally, all events are held at the same time and place to reduce complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Sprint\n",
    "Sprints are the heartbeat of Scrum, where ideas are turned into value.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are **fixed length events of one month or less** to create consistency. A new Sprint starts immediately\n",
    "after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the work necessary to achieve the Product Goal, including Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint\n",
    "Review, and Sprint Retrospective, happen within Sprints. Each sprint should bring the product closer to the Product Goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the Sprint:\n",
    "- No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;\n",
    "- Quality does not decrease;\n",
    "- The Product Backlog is refined as needed; and,\n",
    "- Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sprints enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a Product Goal at least every calendar month. When a Sprint’s horizon is too long (larger than one month) the Sprint Goal may become invalid, complexity may rise, and risk may increase.  Shorter Sprints can be employed to generate more learning cycles and limit risk of cost and effort to a smaller time frame. Each Sprint may be considered a short project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sprint progress can be measured in several ways like burn-downs, burn-ups or cummulative flows, however, given the nature of empiricism on which Scrum is based, it is hard to predict what is going to happen during the sprint. Only what has already happened may be used for forward-looking decision making.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Sprint could be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sprint Planning\n",
    "The entire scrum team establishes the sprint goal, what can be done, and how the chosen work will be completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sprint Planning initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the Sprint. This resulting plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team. The Product Owner ensures that attendees are prepared to discuss the most important Product Backlog items and how they map to the Product Goal. The Scrum Team may also invite other people to attend\n",
    "Sprint Planning to provide advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sprint Planning addresses the following topics:\n",
    "- Why is this Sprint valuable?\n",
    "    - The Product Owner proposes how the product could increase its value and utility in the current Sprint. \n",
    "- What can be Done this Sprint?\n",
    "    - Through discussion with the Product Owner, the Developers select items from the Product Backlog to include in the current Sprint. The Scrum Team may refine these items during this process, which increases understanding and confidence.\n",
    "    - Selecting how much can be completed within a Sprint may be challenging. However, the more the Developers know about their past performance, their upcoming capacity, and their Definition of Done, the more confident they will be in their Sprint forecasts.\n",
    "- How will the chosen work get done?\n",
    "    - For each selected Product Backlog item, the Developers plan the work necessary to create an Increment that meets the Definition of Done. This is often done by decomposing Product Backlog items into smaller work items of one day or less. How this is done is at the sole discretion of the Developers. No one else tells them how to turn Product Backlog items into Increments of value\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sprint Goal, the Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus the plan for delivering them are\n",
    "together referred to as the *Sprint Backlog*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Planning should be timeboxed to a maximum of 8 hours for a month-long sprint, with a shorter timebox for shorter sprints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Daily Scrum\n",
    "The developers (team members delivering the work) inspect the progress toward the sprint goal and adapt the sprint backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.\n",
    "\n",
    "A daily scrum should be timeboxed to 15 minutes each day. To reduce complexity, it is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint. If the Product Owner or Scrum Master are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work. This creates focus and improves self-management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usualy, during the Daily Scrum, every developer informs status towards Sprint Goal answering these questions:\n",
    "- Since the last daily scrum, what have you've been working on?\n",
    "- What are your plans to work on until next daily scrum?\n",
    "- Is there anything preventing you from making progress?\n",
    "\n",
    "Daily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Daily Scrum is not the only time Developers are allowed to adjust their plan. They often meet throughout the day for more detailed discussions about adapting or re-planning the rest of the Sprint’s work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sprint Review\n",
    "The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The entire Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed. Stakeholders are invited to provide feedback on the increment.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the event, the Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the Sprint and what has changed in their environment. Based on this information, attendees collaborate on what to do next. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted to meet new opportunities. The Sprint Review is a working session and the Scrum Team should avoid limiting it to a presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sprint Review is the second to last event of the Sprint and is timeboxed to a maximum of four hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sprint Retrospective\n",
    "The scrum team inspects how the last sprint went regarding individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and definition of done. The team identifies improvements to make the next sprint more effective and enjoyable. The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Scrum Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it encountered, and how those problems were (or\n",
    "were not) solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Scrum Team identifies the most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness. The most impactful improvements are addressed as soon as possible. They may even be added to the Sprint Backlog for the next Sprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrospective is timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a one month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the conclusion of the sprint. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How it all works together?\n",
    "Scrum artifacts and events work together within a sprint cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The product owner defines a vision using information from stakeholders and users. They identify and define pieces of value that can be delivered to move closer towards the product goal.\n",
    "2. Before the developers can work on any pieces of value, the product owner must order the backlog so that the team knows what is most important (Priorities matter!).\n",
    "3. The team can help the product owner further refine what needs to be done, and the product owner may rely on the developers to help them understand requirements and make trade-off decisions. (This is where refinement becomes an important tool for the scrum team.)\n",
    "4. During sprint planning, the developers pull a chunk from the top of the prioritized product backlog and decide how they will complete it.\n",
    "5. The team has a set time frame, **the sprint**, to complete their work.\n",
    "6. Team meet at the daily scrum to inspect progress towards the sprint goal and plan for the upcoming day (Scrum Master keeps the team focused on the sprint goal and can help the team improve as a whole).\n",
    "7. At the end of the sprint, the work should be potentially shippable and ready to be used by a user or shown to a stakeholder.\n",
    "8. After each sprint, the team conducts a sprint review on the Increment and takes feedback from stakeholders. This may lead to new backlog items.\n",
    "9. At the end of the sprint, team conducts a retrospective on the process. \n",
    "10. Then they choose the next chunk of the backlog and the cycle repeats.\n",
    "\n",
